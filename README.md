This repository is used for the project of the Copernicus class

'copernicus.ipynb' downloads the Sentinel data for estimating Manning's roughness coefficients
The atmospheric forcings for the Po Plain model is very large, it cannot be uploaded to the repository, as well as my other repositories. They are saved in my CFDHub account, a folder named 'huiminw' in /global-scratch/bulk_pool

'0_clm_2023.py' shows the Po Plain model with the atmospheric forcings of the year 2023
'visualize_outputs.ipynb' plots and analyzes the outputs from the Po Plain model

'ParFlow_test.py' runs a small box model for testing the heterogeneous Manning's roughness coefficient
'plot_outputs.ipynb' plots and analyzes the outputs from the small box model
